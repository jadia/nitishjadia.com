I have started a 90-day process to do what I should be doing, not what my mind tells me to do. 
In short, I stopped consuming news, social media, TV shows, and YouTube content altogether. I went cold turkey on everything which I knew I was doing wrong but still won't take any actions to correct them.

Every day I have started going for a walk (yes, during COVID-19 lockdown), exercise at home (Gyms are closed), and started 15-min meditation. 

I have also started working on a few small goals like increasing my touch typing speed, start writing (hence this post), improve my handwriting (especially on iPad) and get bored. Yes getting bored is a part of my routine now. I came to realise that getting bored is very important _activity_. When you get bored, you tend to think about your actions in the past or plans far ahead in the future. It also helps you to keep your mind uncluttered by sorting things that you never touch when you are occupied with social media. 


I use to watch YouTube, TV series, or anything to keep myself occupied while having food. I would leave my work in the middle to browse Instagram or Facebook. My focus towards work started deteriorating and my attention span became next to none, thanks to all the dopamine hit I get through tweets and Instagram pictures.


I'm sure I'm not addicted to a particular social networking app, but I'm 100% addicted to do anything but work. See, working requires you to solve problems - which means you might be stuck on something for days and the deadline gets closer and closer. So what do I do? Panic! and find a way to get rid of this awful feeling. This brings me back to mindlessly scrolling through social media or watch TV shows.

I acknowledge the issues I have and I know that with proper discipline and enough will power I can overcome them. I believe that this 90-day project of mine would help me tremendously.

TLDR to below four paragraphs: Start being mindful about every activity.

I texted a friend of mine asking "How can I improve my handwriting?". She replied -   

> "You have to be aware while writing and be mindful about the words way you want your letters to be written".  

Then I remembered the first time I experienced the power of mindfulness. When I was a child during the cricket match I couldn't hit the ball properly, I would swing the ball aimlessly whenever the ball is thrown towards me. Suddenly, I thought about observing the way I swing the bat and correct it with every ball. Eventually, in a few overs, my batting improved drastically. 

The same thing can be applied to everything. I've been touch typing for years but I never crossed certain words per minute because when I increase my typing speed, the accuracy takes a major hit. 

Now while typing I'm mindful about being accurate and pressing the right key with the correct finger and this is helping me improve without putting additional time in practicing touch typing.


## Week 1

Breaking up with social media and TV series gave me a lot to time at hand. I get withdrawal symptoms - at times when I'm working, I feel like getting up and do _something_. That _something_ use to be - browsing social media or watching TV series. Not anymore.  

Since I'm not watching anything while having food, now I join my family for lunch and dinner. Spending more time with them during this lockdown is one the best thing I'm doing right now.

I'm still having trouble sleeping on time. My body clock is messed up, sometimes I'm able to sleep early but often I would stay awake for hours at night.

I'm getting more work done since I am not occupied with anything else apart from work. When I get bored, I think about my University project and plan about the months ahead. I take up some tasks which were on my todo list for a long time. I'm not wasting much time now. When I go to bed and I reflect upon my day, I have a bunch of tasks that I completed.

I have blocked all social media on my phone and iPad. Not even YouTube works. At times I find myself opening Twitter or Reddit apps since none of them works, I again lock the phone and keep it aside. 


**I will keep updating about my further progress in the coming weeks.**
